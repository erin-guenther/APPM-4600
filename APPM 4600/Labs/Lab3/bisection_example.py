# Solutions:
#Q1(a): 
# 
# the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
# the error message reads: 0
# f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08

#Q1(b):
# 
# the approximate root is -1
# the error message reads: 1
# f(astar) = -2

#Q1(c):
# the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
# the error message reads: 0
# f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08

#Q1 discussion: It isn't possible to find the root x=0 using bisection due to the fact that the root has a multiplicity of 2.
# (This means that the function does not cross the axis). The intervals in (a) and (c) work because they contain a root, but (b)
# does not because there is no root with odd multiplicity within the interval (-1,0.5).

#Q2(a):
# the approximate root is 1.0000030517578122
# the error message reads: 0
# f(astar) = 2.4414006618542327e-05

#Q2(b):
# the approximate root is 0
# the error message reads: 1
# f(astar) = -3

#Q2(c):
# the approximate root is 0
# the error message reads: 0
# f(astar) = 0.0
