This repo contains all of my code and outputs for my Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing class (APPM 4600). I have two main folders titled Homework and Labs. Within each folder, there is an individual folder for each assignment or lab to keep things separate and organized. I will also have code outputs (such as important plots or graphs) in these subfolders as well. Each Homework folder will follow the convention of HW#, and then .py files within each homework will be labeled according to the number of problem they correspond to. Plots will be saved as .png files and will also be named based off of the problem they correspond to.
