This repo contains all of my code and outputs for my Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing class (APPM 4600). I have two main folders titled Homework and Labs. Within each folder, there is an individual folder for each assignment or lab to keep things separate and organized. I will also have code outputs (such as important plots or graphs) in these subfolders as well. Each Homework folder will follow the convention of HW#, and then .py files within each homework will be labeled according to the number of problem they correspond to.
